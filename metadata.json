  "description": "App grid & favorites & workspaces & tasks in panel. Light extension.\n\n Replace 'Activities' button by all current workspaces and apps buttons. Switch workspace/app or toggle overview by clicking on these buttons. Change 'Places' label to an icon.\n\n You can use names for workspaces: there are two ways for that. 1) Edit the string array 'org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.workspace-names' gsettings key (through dconf editor, e.g.). 2) Use official GNOME extension Workspaces Indicator's settings. You don't have to write a long enough list: numbers are displayed if no workspace name is defined.\n\n No preferences UI at the moment but you can find some options in extension.js. Please use Simple Task Bar or Dash to Panel if you want that. If you want only workspaces and no tasks, please consider Worskpaces Bar extension",
