  "description": "Task bar. App grid, favorites, workspaces and tasks in panel. Light extension.\n\n Replace 'Activities' button by all current workspaces and apps buttons. Switch workspace/app or toggle overview by clicking on these buttons. Drag and drop favorite, task, dash item or app grid item to any workspace (you cannot reorder tasks inside a workspace). Persistent window preview with right-click (right-click again or click on preview to close it). You can move this preview anywhere. Change 'Places' label to an icon. Settings in preferences UI.\n\n You can use names for workspaces: there are two ways for that. 1) Edit the string array 'org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.workspace-names' gsettings key (through dconf editor, e.g.). 2) Use official GNOME extension Workspaces Indicator's settings. You don't have to write a long enough list: numbers are displayed if no workspace name is defined.\n\n Changelog: https://github.com/hseliger/babar/issues/2",
